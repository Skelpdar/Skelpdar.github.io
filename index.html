	Software Renderer
	</h2>
	<img src="https://github.com/Skelpdar/Skelpdar.github.io/blob/master/Progress09.PNG?raw=true">
	<b>Description:</b> 
	A 3D-rendering engine created as my high school thesis project. 
	It uses SDL for graphic hardware access and Eigen for optimization.
	All other 3D-rendering functionality is written by me from scratch. 
	<br>
	<b>Language and framework:</b> C++ and SDL<br>
	
	<h2>
	Isometric Unity Game
	<img src="https://github.com/Skelpdar/Skelpdar.github.io/blob/master/grovsylt1.PNG?raw=true">

	<b>Description:</b> A so far unnamed unity engine project 
	that I am currently working on as the only programmer,
	along with two graphic artists. 
	<br>
	<b>Language and framework:</b> C# and Unity engine.
	
	<h2>
	Pyrate Map Generator

	<b>Description:</b>
	A program that procedurally generates height data for a bunch of islands, and as the name suggests,
	creates a pirate treasure map from this data. It is used here as an example of my python scripting
	abilities.

	<b>Language and framework: Python</b>
